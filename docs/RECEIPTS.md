# Dema Receipts v0.1

A receipt is Dema's way of saying:

```text
what happened,
what did not happen,
what evidence exists,
and what the next safe action is.
```

## Why receipts matter

Most AI tools ask users to trust invisible actions.

Dema uses receipts to make important steps inspectable. A receipt should help a user answer:

- What action was proposed?
- What action actually happened?
- What action did not happen?
- What evidence supports the result?
- What is the next safe action?

## Local-first storage

By default, receipts live under:

```text
~/.dema/receipts/
```

The folder is created by:

```bash
dema setup
```

## CLI commands

List receipts:

```bash
dema receipts
```

Read one receipt:

```bash
dema receipts ARTIFACT-011
```

The selector may be a receipt ID, artifact ID, exact path, or receipt filename.

## ARTIFACT-011 boundary

ARTIFACT-011 is the first bounded diagnostic runtime receipt.

`dema mission propose` may preview readiness for ARTIFACT-011, but it must not create the receipt.

The actual runtime path remains gated by exact consent:

```text
GO: Node0 bounded diagnostic activation only
```

## Receipt quality bar

A useful receipt should be:

- human-readable
- timestamped
- linked to the action it describes
- explicit about what did not happen
- clear about the next safe action

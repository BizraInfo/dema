# PAT-Builder / SAT-Validator Doctrine — v0.1

**Status:** doctrine, layered above [A4.5 Dema Autonomy Envelope](dema-autonomy-envelope.md). Truth label: **DECLARED**.

**Bound by:** [ADR-001](../06-adr/ADR-001-dema-is-one-face.md), [ADR-003](../06-adr/ADR-003-core-truth-lives-in-bizra-omega.md), [ADR-005](../06-adr/ADR-005-operator-actions-require-explicit-consent.md), the A4.5 envelope, and the repo invariants in [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md).

**One-line summary:** PAT + Dema build. SAT validates. The operator sees Dema. **Even the operator cannot bypass SAT.**

> **PAT may build. Dema may face the user. SAT validates. FATE gates. Receipts witness. No actor, including the founder, bypasses the law.**

## Why this exists (and why now)

The Autonomy Envelope (A4.5, merged as PR #11) named *what* Dema may do at L0–L5. This doc names *which side of the BIZRA topology executes each level* and codifies the constitutional separation of authority within a single node.

The Pi Verifier Agent ([ABSORPTION_NOTES_v2.md](../ABSORPTION_NOTES_v2.md)) gave Dema the doctrine-as-template pattern (V1) and the CONFIDENCE ladder (V2). But that reference project has no constitutional layer above persona — its own author can edit the persona file and silently weaken the rules. **PAT/SAT separation IS the constitutional layer the verifier-agent lacks.**

The need is now: SEED has just closed via ARTIFACT-011 (chain length > 0; gateway POST `/missions` returned PERMIT; local handoff receipt mirrored to `~/.dema/receipts/artifact-011.json`). SPROUT begins. The "operator cannot bypass system law, including me" invariant must be on disk *before* SPROUT's continuous bounded diagnostics start producing receipts that depend on it.

## The architecture: one node, seven components

Per [BIZRA Third Fact v0.1 §III](../../BIZRA_Third_Fact_v0_1_FINAL.pdf):

> **NODE ARCHITECTURE — every human node CONTAINS:**
> PAT · SAT · DEMA · FATE · URP · RECEIPTS · POI

There is **one node per human** containing **seven components**. PAT and SAT are two of those seven, both internal to the same node, both serving the same sovereign — but with separated authority. Federation is between *nodes*, not between components within a node.

The PAT-builder / SAT-validator separation is therefore an **internal** separation of authority within one node. PAT (with Dema as the visible bridge) builds and proposes; SAT validates and certifies; the operator only sees Dema. SAT's verdict is mandatory for any L4+ act, and the operator cannot bypass it.

## The two sides

| Side | Role | Members | Visible to operator? | Authority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **PAT + Dema** | Builder | 7 PAT agents (`bizra-omega/bizra-agent/src/roster.rs:128`, `PAT_SIZE: usize = 7`) + Dema bridge | Yes — only Dema is surfaced | Proposes, executes reversible work, drafts |
| **SAT** | Validator | 5 SAT agents (declared in `bizra-py311-baseline-wt/00_CONSTITUTION/TOPOLOGY_CANON.md:50-56` — S1 Validator, S2 Oracle [FROZEN], S3 Mediator, S4 Archivist, S5 Sentinel) | No — Dema does not surface SAT | Certifies. Cannot be bypassed. |

The Forge/Crown pattern at `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION_CHAIN.md:189-194` (P3 Forge ≡ Builder; P5 Crown ≡ Verifier) is the existing pre-figuration of this split. PAT/SAT generalizes it to system-wide separation across the whole node.

## The PAT/SAT × A4.5 level matrix

| A4.5 Level | PAT-Builder action | SAT-Validator action | Receipt? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L0** Observe | PAT/Dema reads | SAT silent (read does not require certification) | No |
| **L1** Remember | PAT/Dema writes `~/.dema/` | SAT silent (local memory is builder-scoped) | No |
| **L2** Propose | PAT/Dema generates proposal (`executes:false`) | SAT silent (proposals are data, not acts) | The proposal IS the artifact |
| **L3** Reversible local | PAT/Dema edits/commits on feature branch | SAT silent (reversible, undoable) | Optional |
| **L4** Governed mutation | PAT/Dema submits via gateway (`packages/node-adapter/src/gateway-http-adapter.js`) | **SAT runs admissibility chain** (`bizra-omega/bizra-cognition/src/admissibility_freeze_v1.rs`) — Ihsān ≥0.95, Adl, Guardian, Confidence ≥0.80; emits `GateVerdict::PERMIT` | **Required.** No PERMIT → no L4 receipt. |
| **L5** Irreversible | PAT/Dema prepares the act (push, PR, stamp, sign) | **SAT certifies + cross-references** the external commitment | Required + external ref |

The matrix's mechanic: **L4 is the constitutional crossing.** Below L4, PAT acts alone. At L4 and above, SAT must certify or no receipt is born.

## The Lamport framing

Cite `bizra-omega/bizra-agent/src/runtime.rs:6` (R1 = "chain is truth, graph is derived state"). The receipt chain implements Lamport-style happens-before: each receipt carries `prev_hash`; the chain enforces a total order over the system's history (Genesis → Entry1 → Entry2 …). Tampered chains fail `continuity_verification` (`receipts.rs:369`).

In Lamport terms: **an event has not "happened" in the system until it appears on the hash-chained receipt log.** PAT proposes (L2/L3 artifacts) → SAT validates (admissibility chain returns PERMIT) → chain appends (L4 receipt with `prev_hash`). Until that append, the act is unwitnessed and therefore *did not occur for the system*.

Contrast with the verifier-agent (per [ABSORPTION_NOTES_v2.md](../ABSORPTION_NOTES_v2.md) V1–V6): its `CONFIDENCE: VERIFIED` is a *report*, not a certification — the build proceeds either way. SAT's `PERMIT` is a *certification* — without it, no receipt, no system-recognized event. **This is the constitutional layer above persona that the verifier-agent does not have.**

## The "sovereign-bypass" anti-pattern

This extends [A4.5 §"Anti-patterns explicitly forbidden"](dema-autonomy-envelope.md) (which lists patterns 1–5). Add as **anti-pattern 6**:

> **Sovereign-bypass.** No actor — PAT agent, Dema bridge, gateway, or operator — may issue an L4+ receipt without SAT certification. Operator typing the consent phrase satisfies *gating* (per ADR-005); it does NOT satisfy *certification*. The two are independent: consent authorizes the *attempt*; SAT decides whether the *attempt* is admissible. An L4 receipt absent a SAT verdict is malformed and MUST be rejected by the chain reader. The receipt schema SHOULD carry a `sat_verdict` field with values from `GateVerdict` (`PERMIT` / `REJECT` / `REVIEW` / `SCORE_ONLY`); only `PERMIT` permits `truth_label: MEASURED` for the receipt.

This is the operator's own stated invariant codified: *"we will not accept any exception about system law, including me."*

## V1–V6 mapping (verifier-agent absorbed patterns → PAT/SAT positions)

| Pattern | Lives on | How |
|---|---|---|
| V1 doctrine-as-template | PAT side (Dema persona; future verifier sibling persona) | Builder agents have prompt templates; SAT does not — SAT is a chain of typed gates, not a persona |
| V2 CONFIDENCE ladder | PAT report shape | Builder emits CONFIDENCE; SAT emits GateVerdict — different vocabularies, both required |
| V3 unverifiable[] gaps | PAT receipt payload | Builder records what it could not verify; SAT records what it would not certify |
| V4 decomposition discipline | PAT side (CLAIM_MUST_BIND extended) | Builder breaks claims atomic; SAT certifies atom-by-atom |
| V5 three-layer bash defense | PAT side (L0 enforcement on Dema + verifier sibling) | SAT does not run bash — it consumes payloads |
| V6 max_loops escalation | PAT-side persona constant | After N corrective cycles without SAT PERMIT → escalate to operator |

**Conclusion: all six absorbed patterns live on the PAT side. SAT is a separate axis the verifier-agent did not have.**

## Receipt-chain shape (DECLARED, not MEASURED)

Three-step lifecycle:

1. **PAT proposes** → L2 proposal artifact (e.g. `dema mission propose`, `apps/cli/src/index.js`); `executes: false`.
2. **SAT validates** → admissibility chain (`bizra-omega/bizra-cognition/src/admissibility_freeze_v1.rs`, `AdmissibilityChain` fail-closed pipeline) returns `GateVerdict`.
3. **Chain appends** → L4 receipt to `~/.dema/receipts/` viewable via `dema receipts` (`packages/receipts/src/receipt-store.js`); receipt SHOULD include `sat_verdict`, `proposal_hash`, `consent_phrase_hash`, `prev_hash`.

**`sat_verdict` field status: DECLARED only.** No schema implementation in this doc's PR. Future receipt readers fall back to "absent → REVIEW required" until the field is wired through the receipt schema in `packages/receipts/`.

### FATE gate roles disambiguated

Today's docs occasionally conflate two distinct FATE gates. This doc draws the line:

- **Dema-side FATE** (`packages/fate/src/fate.js`) = **consent gate**. Operator authorization (exact-string phrase). Authorizes the *attempt* at L4.
- **Rust-side FATE** (4-gate chain: Ihsān ≥0.95, Adl, Guardian, Confidence ≥0.80) = **SAT's substrate**. Certifies the *admissibility* of the attempt at L4.

These are NOT the same gate. Consent and certification are independent. Both required.

## Where today's code sits

| Surface | Side | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Dema CLI commands (`apps/cli/src/index.js`) | PAT-Builder | All L0–L2; one L4-gating surface (`mission propose`) |
| Gateway HTTP adapter (`packages/node-adapter/src/gateway-http-adapter.js`) | PAT-Builder transport | GET-only; submission path is upstream |
| `packages/fate/src/fate.js` | PAT-Builder consent gate | Authorizes the *attempt* at L4 |
| `~/.dema/memory/a5-niyyah.json` | PAT-Builder L1 declared intent | Operator's typed niyyah; L1 until SAT certifies its carrying receipt at L4 |
| `bizra-omega/bizra-cognition/src/admissibility_freeze_v1.rs` | SAT substrate (lives upstream) | Certifies admissibility at L4 |
| **SAT-5 Rust roster (S1–S5 structs)** | **GAP** — DECLARED in TOPOLOGY_CANON.md:50-56, not MEASURED | Follow-up for `bizra-data-lake`, NOT Dema scope |

Every Dema CLI surface today is **L0–L2**. ARTIFACT-011 was the first L4 act (issued via gateway POST /missions Path A; chain length 8). L4 lives upstream of this repo per CLAUDE.md invariant #1.

## The SAT-5 roster gap

PAT-7 has a Rust roster (`PAT_SIZE: usize = 7` at `bizra-omega/bizra-agent/src/roster.rs:128`). SAT-5 does not yet have an equivalent struct. This doc DECLARES the architecture; the Rust-side instantiation of SAT as a live roster is a `bizra-data-lake` concern, out of Dema scope.

| Artifact | Truth label |
|---|---|
| This doctrine doc | **DECLARED** |
| PAT-7 Rust roster | MEASURED |
| SAT-5 Rust roster | **PLANNED** (bizra-data-lake-scoped) |
| `sat_verdict` receipt field | **DECLARED** (no implementation in this PR) |

## How to confirm this doc landed cleanly

After this doc commits:

```bash

git diff --stat HEAD~1   # 1 file changed

# Tests still pass (doc-only, no code surface change)

# Confirm each cited path resolves under /data/bizra/repos/bizra-data-lake/
```

A4.5 compliance check: anti-pattern 6 (sovereign-bypass) is ADDITIVE only — it does not contradict A4.5's anti-patterns 1–5. Read both side-by-side to verify.

## Versioning

This document is v0.1.

- **Tightening edits** (more restrictive PAT/SAT separation, narrower L4 admissibility, additional forbidden patterns) → standard PR review.
- **Loosening edits** (e.g., allowing L4 receipt without `sat_verdict`, weakening sovereign-bypass) → require operator typed GO + new ADR. The "no exception, including the founder" invariant is itself unconditional in v0.1; if it ever needs an exception, that exception requires its own constitutional act.

## Provenance note

This doc originated as the plan written to `~/.claude/plans/unified-finding-lamport.md` during a plan-mode session on 2026-05-06. The operator correctly noted that constitutional project memory does not belong in tooling state — it belongs in the repo where auditors can see it. This file is the migration. The original plan-file may be deleted or kept as a session artifact at the operator's discretion; the canonical doctrine lives here.

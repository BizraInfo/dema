## What DEMA owns

| Domain | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| Product UX | Dashboard, onboarding, settings, command surface |
| Rendering | Trust strip, receipt chain, manifest cards, state gap |
| Research surface | Perplexity integration, citation display, research library |
| Operator surfaces | Browser actions, computer actions, permission dialogs |
| Local state | Preferences, UI state, research cache, local memory |
| CLI packaging | Command definitions, TUI rendering, output formatting |
| Desktop shell | Window management, tray, native integrations |
| Design system | Tokens, typography, icons, component library |

## What bizra-omega owns

| Domain | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| Mission law | Mission types, state machines, lifecycle |
| Admissibility | Input validation, constitutional checks |
| Receipts | Receipt creation, signing, chain integrity |
| Trust engine | Trust scoring, state transitions, decay |
| Manifests | Manifest creation, artifact binding |
| Chain | Append-only history, integrity verification |
| Gateway | API contracts, auth, rate limiting |

## What crosses the boundary

### DEMA → Core (writes)

- Submit new task/mission (via gateway)
- Request action execution (via gateway)
- Submit user preference changes that affect trust (via gateway)

### Core → DEMA (reads)

- Trust state snapshot
- Latest receipts (paginated)
- Active manifests
- Current → ideal state gap
- Mission status
- Admissibility result for proposed actions

## Violation checklist

If any of these are true, the boundary is broken:

- [ ] DEMA has a `trust-engine/` or `admissibility/` directory
- [ ] DEMA creates `Receipt` objects directly (not via gateway)
- [ ] DEMA maintains mission state machines
- [ ] DEMA runs chain validation logic
- [ ] DEMA has gateway endpoint definitions (those belong in omega)
- [ ] DEMA interprets constitutional rules (it only displays results)

## Contract sync

`scripts/sync-contracts.sh` runs on CI and verifies:

1. All types in `packages/schemas/` match the corresponding gateway response shapes
2. All SDK methods in `packages/sdk/` have corresponding gateway endpoints
3. No orphaned contracts exist on either side

# Gateway HTTP adapter (ADR-003 implementation)

The Dema HTTP adapter consumes the live `bizra-cognition-gateway` (per [ADR-003](../06-adr/ADR-003-core-truth-lives-in-bizra-omega.md)) and composes a Dema-facing status envelope. It is the second backend for `createNode0Adapter()` — the first remains the legacy shellout to `DEMA_NODE0_STATUS_COMMAND`.

## Activation

```bash
export DEMA_NODE0_ADAPTER=gateway-http
export DEMA_GATEWAY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7421     # default if unset
node apps/cli/src/index.js status
```

The dispatch lives in `packages/node-adapter/src/node0-adapter.js`:

- `adapterMode === "gateway-http"` → `createGatewayHttpAdapter({...})`
- otherwise → existing shellout (or `defaultStatus()` when nothing configured)

The shellout backend is unchanged. Existing tests that exercise it pass without modification.

## Endpoints consumed (read-only)

| Endpoint | Purpose | Composed into |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /health` | Domain identity + reachability | `gateway.{reachable, domain, health}` |
| `GET /chain` | Receipt chain head + length | `chain.{head, length, latestTimestamp}`, `proof.latestChainHash`, `missionExecuted` |
| `GET /poi/summary` | POI ledger summary | `poi.{totalEntries, totalImpact, avgImpact}` |
| `GET /resources/list` | Registered resources | `resources.count` |

The adapter NEVER calls `POST` and NEVER calls any of `/missions/*`, `/principal/activate`, `/resources/register`, `/missions/organize`. It is a pure read surface.

## Composed schema

`bizra.dema.node0_status.v0.2` — superset of the shellout adapter's `bizra.dema.status.v0.1`. Preserves the v0.1 fields that `formatStatus` and `isReadyForBoundedDiagnostic` consume (so existing CLI surface keeps working), additively extended with `gateway`, `chain`, `poi`, `resources`, `unknown`, `truth_label`, and `source`.

Example output against a healthy, empty-chain gateway:

```json

  ]
}
```

## Honesty rules (all enforced by tests)

1. **`ready` is always `false`.** The gateway being live is necessary but not sufficient. Only the first ARTIFACT-011 issuance — driven by the governed bounded-diagnostic runtime path that lives upstream of Dema (per repo invariant #1) — flips Node0 into SPROUT readiness. The adapter cannot fabricate this flip.
2. **`truth_label`** is `MEASURED_PARTIAL` when the gateway is reachable and identifies as `bizra-cognition-gateway-v1`, otherwise `DEGRADED`.
3. **`unknown[]`** lists every conceptually load-bearing field the gateway does NOT expose. The adapter never invents values for these (no fake `lm_studio.connected`, no guessed `human`).
4. **Network failure never throws.** A connection error returns a `DEGRADED` status with one finding per failed endpoint, so `dema status` still produces an honest report when the gateway is down.
5. **`rust_bus.ready` is inferred from gateway uptime** (the gateway runs on top of the rust bus; if the gateway responds, the rust bus is up). This single inference is recorded in `unknown[]` so future readers can audit the assumption.
6. **No POSTs, ever.** The adapter is pure read. Tests assert this by recording every method/path the fake gateway sees.

## Verification

```bash
# Local-only (no network), against a fake gateway in-process:
npm test                                # 9 new tests in tests/gateway-http-adapter.test.js

# Against the real gateway (must already be running on 127.0.0.1:7421):
DEMA_NODE0_ADAPTER=gateway-http \
  node apps/cli/src/index.js status

# Both backends side by side:
node apps/cli/src/index.js status                                    # shellout (or defaultStatus)
DEMA_NODE0_ADAPTER=gateway-http node apps/cli/src/index.js status    # gateway-http
```

## Out of scope

- **Gateway uptime / process management.** Dema does not start, stop, or supervise the gateway. The gateway runs (or doesn't) under whatever process supervisor the operator configured upstream.
- **Mission submission.** `POST /mission` and friends are runtime mutations and live behind the FATE consent gate + the governed runtime path elsewhere — never from this adapter.
- **Composite Node0 health beyond what the gateway exposes.** LM Studio status, PyO3 bridge status, preferred name, etc. are explicitly `unknown`. Adding them belongs upstream (in the gateway's surface) or in a separate adapter.
